1.Let's outline the steps for the Number Game project in Java:

1. Import necessary libraries: We'll need `Scanner` for user input and `Random` for generating random numbers.
2. Define main class and methods:
    - `generateRandomNumber`: Generates a random number within a specified range.
    - `getUserGuess`: Prompts the user for their guess and returns it.
    - `compareGuess`: Compares the user's guess to the generated number and returns feedback.
    - `playRound`: Handles the logic for playing a single round of the game.
    - `main`: Orchestrates the game flow, including multiple rounds and scoring.

3. Game logic:
    - Generate a random number.
    - Prompt the user for a guess.
    - Provide feedback if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
    - Track the number of attempts.
    - Allow for multiple rounds and display the user's score.

Here is the full implementation of the Number Game project in Java:



import java.util.Random;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Game {
    private static final int MAX_ATTEMPTS = 10;
    private static final int LOWER_BOUND = 1;
    private static final int UPPER_BOUND = 100;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int roundsPlayed = 0;
        int totalScore = 0;

        System.out.println("Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!");

        while (true) {
            roundsPlayed++;
            int roundScore = playRound(scanner);
            totalScore += roundScore;

            System.out.println("Do you want to play another round? (yes/no)");
            String playAgain = scanner.next();

            if (!playAgain.equalsIgnoreCase("yes")) {
                break;
            }
        }

        System.out.println("Thank you for playing!");
        System.out.println("Rounds played: " + roundsPlayed);
        System.out.println("Total score: " + totalScore);
    }

    private static int playRound(Scanner scanner) {
        Random random = new Random();
        int numberToGuess = random.nextInt(UPPER_BOUND - LOWER_BOUND + 1) + LOWER_BOUND;
        int attemptsLeft = MAX_ATTEMPTS;
        int attemptsUsed = 0;

        System.out.println("I have generated a number between " + LOWER_BOUND + " and " + UPPER_BOUND + ". Can you guess it?");
        
        while (attemptsLeft > 0) {
            System.out.println("You have " + attemptsLeft + " attempts left. Enter your guess:");
            int userGuess = getUserGuess(scanner);

            attemptsUsed++;
            attemptsLeft--;

            if (userGuess == numberToGuess) {
                System.out.println("Congratulations! You guessed the correct number in " + attemptsUsed + " attempts.");
                return MAX_ATTEMPTS - attemptsUsed + 1; // Score based on attempts left
            } else if (userGuess < numberToGuess) {
                System.out.println("Too low!");
            } else {
                System.out.println("Too high!");
            }
        }

        System.out.println("Sorry, you've used all your attempts. The correct number was: " + numberToGuess);
        return 0; // No score if attempts are exhausted
    }

    private static int getUserGuess(Scanner scanner) {
        while (true) {
            try {
                return Integer.parseInt(scanner.next());
            } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
                System.out.println("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.");
            }
        }
    }
}
